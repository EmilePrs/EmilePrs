### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


ðŸ”­ 
Iâ€™m currently working at the Empowerment Foundation dedicated to new technology ethic and gender equality. I'm also studying at the University of Lausanne, finishing a 2 years Master in Management specialized in Business Analytics. 
The data science is a way to distance myself from the decisions bias, so to limitate the negative impact that they can have on my decisions and my understanding of the mechanism of the world. 
I'm particularly interested in mixing economical subject with sociology, psychology and geopolitics.
